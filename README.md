# Python Challenge

# Introduction:
This project consists of two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll, aimed at analyzing financial records and election data respectively. These tasks simulate real-world situations where Python scripting skills are required to process and analyze datasets efficiently.

# Before You Begin:
- Download the "budget_data.csv" file and the "election_data.csv" file to ensure the python codes runs properly

# PyBank Instructions
In this challenge, you'll analyze financial records to calculate various metrics such as total months, net total amount of profit/losses, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits over a given period.

# PyPoll Instructions
In this challenge, you'll modernize a vote-counting process by analyzing poll data to calculate various metrics such as total votes cast, list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.





















To start off, one must download the "budget_data.csv" file and the "election_data.csv" file to ensure the python codes runs properly with the right data source.

Once downloaded,open Visual Studio Code and begin by opening the folder within Visual Studio Code that contains both data files provided. 

Both PyBank and PyPoll have text files that summarize their results.

Overall, using Python coding streamlines the process for both problems stated. The codes provided focus on the use of two Python libraries (import os for creating file paths and import csv for reading and writing CSV files)and also focuses on reading the CSV files provided to retrieve the necessary information.
