# Homework 3

Two Python problems are presented here.

1. PyBank:
PyBank focuses on the financial analysis of your company.The code focuses on determining the total number of months in the data set. It also calculates the net total amount of profits and losses, the average of these profits/losses and it also identifies both the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in losses.

 
2. PyPoll:
PyPoll focuses on helping a small town modernize their voting counting process. It performs tasks like tallying the number of votes, presenting a list of candidates, determining the percent value of votes each candidate received, tracking the number each candidate got, and revealing the winner based on who got the highest vote count.

To start off, one must download the "budget_data.csv" file and the "election_data.csv" file to ensure the python codes runs properly with the right data source.

Once downloaded,open Visual Studio Code and begin by opening the folder within Visual Studio Code that contains both data files provided. 

Both PyBank and PyPoll have text files that summarize their results.

Overall, using Python coding streamlines the process for both problems stated. The codes provided focus on the use of two Python libraries (import os for creating file paths and import csv for reading and writing CSV files)and also focuses on reading the CSV files provided to retrieve the necessary information.
